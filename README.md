## Hi there üëã
Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Vinicius, please enjoy your stay, and maybe send me a connection request on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinicius-chab/)!

Here you'll get to know me a little better!


## Who am I?
I am a Front End developer with 4+ years of experience, who already worked with small startups and big companies. I have a degree in System Analysis and Development.

I love coding, always working on personal projects and seeking more knowledge. I aspire to be a great developer - and an awesome guy to work with, I have no issues with anybody, and always intend on building friendly relations.

Besides coding, I really like playing video games and going to the beach :)

If you need something, don't be shy, DM me on LinkedIn at any time!
