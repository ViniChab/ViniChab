## Hi there
Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Vinicius.

## Who am I?
I am a Front End developer with 6 years of experience, who already worked with small startups and big companies. I have a degree in System Analysis and Development.

I love coding, always working on personal projects and seeking more knowledge. I aspire to be a great developer - and an awesome guy to work with, I have no issues with anybody, and always intend on building friendly relations.

Besides coding, I really like playing video games and going to the beach.

If you need something, don't be shy, DM me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinicius-chab/) at any time!
